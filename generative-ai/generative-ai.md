## 🎯 Why Generative AI Matters

Generative AI transforms prompts into pixels, prose, or programs — *not by searching*, but by generating. It's not just automation. It's augmentation. Whether you're a creator, developer, or strategist, understanding GenAI means understanding how the future is being built.

## 🧾 Key Terms & Concepts

| Term         | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| GenAI        | Generative AI — systems that generate content (text, code, images) from input prompts. |
| Diffusion    | A class of image generation models using noise and denoising steps. |
| Transformer  | Architecture used in most large-scale GenAI systems like GPT and BERT. |
| Prompt       | The input provided to a GenAI model — its quality shapes the output. |
| Hallucination| When a GenAI model produces plausible but factually wrong output. |
| Red Teaming  | Testing AI systems for vulnerabilities, biases, or unsafe behaviors. |
