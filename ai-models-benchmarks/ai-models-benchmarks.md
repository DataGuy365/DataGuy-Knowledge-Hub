# 🧪 AI Models & Benchmarks – Tracking the State of AI Intelligence

This cluster explores major AI language models (LLMs), multimodal systems, and their performance benchmarks. From OpenAI's GPT series to Anthropic's Claude, Google's Gemini, Alibaba's Qwen, and open-source powerhouses like LLaMA and DeepSeek — this hub covers architecture, upgrades, and comparative evaluations.
