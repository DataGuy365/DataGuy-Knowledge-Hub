# 🧠 Context Engineering – The Intelligence Backbone of LLM Systems

Welcome to the **Context Engineering** hub — where we move beyond prompt crafting and into the world of designing intelligent, memory-aware, modular AI systems.

In this cluster, we explore the principles, pitfalls, and progressions of structuring information flow for large language models (LLMs), especially in multi-agent systems and real-world deployments.

## 📌 Why Context Engineering Matters

Modern LLMs don’t just respond to prompts — they reason across multiple turns, tools, documents, and user states. That demands a system-level approach to context design:

- How is memory retrieved and injected?
- How is user intent tracked across tasks?
- How do agents share state and scratchpads?

This isn’t just prompt engineering. It’s system architecture for intelligence.
