# 📚 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) – Tools, Patterns, and Applications

This cluster focuses on everything RAG — a foundational architecture for improving factual accuracy in LLMs by combining information retrieval with generation. Explore its types, tools, pipelines, challenges, and future directions.

## ⚙️ Why RAG Matters

Large Language Models hallucinate. RAG fixes this — not by fine-tuning, but by *grounding responses in real-world information*. From chatbots to enterprise copilots, RAG is becoming the go-to pattern for building knowledge-aware AI systems.
