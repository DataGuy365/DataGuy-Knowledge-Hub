# â€‹â€‹Multi-Agent Systems â€“ Architectures for Autonomous Collaboration

This cluster organizes curated insights, frameworks, and architectures exploring how multiple AI agents coordinate, share context, and act collaboratively across tasks.

## Why Multi-Agent Systems Matter

Multi-agent systems (MAS) model collaborative AI â€” where multiple agents share knowledge, plan jointly, and operate autonomously. They enable modular reasoning, scalable workflows, and human-like coordination in real-world applications.
